# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
My analysis on the Pewlett Hackard Data.

# Overview of Project
	The data provided to me in 6 separate csv files, represent a 	raw information of Pewlett Hackard Company. 

# Purpose
To help Bobby to simply understand the provided data and 	giving him elements to make the right decision on how to deal with the different waves of employees’ retirement.
# Analysis and Challenges
	Many SQL functions did not work well when running my code until I've 	updated my material version.


# Results
	Among the employees about to retire:
•	32.54% of them were senior engineer and only 0.77% were replaced for the same position
•	31.25 of them were senior staff and only 1.77% were replaced for the same position.
•	15.73% of them were engineer and only 3.18% were replaced for the same position.
•	4.98% of them were technique leader and only 1.69% were replaced for the same position.
•	1.95% of them were assistant engineer and only 3.80% were replaced for the same position.

# Summary
I do not have access to see Pewlett Hackard financial reports, but if its finance is sufficient to hire and train new employees and quickly replacing those who have been promoted, then it would be the best time.
The company will experience future crisis, especially if it has contracts with costumers because the production slop will experience some decreases unless if the company invested and made technology improvement to replace the human hands.
